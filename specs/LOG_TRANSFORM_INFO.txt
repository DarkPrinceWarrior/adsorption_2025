LOG-TRANSFORM APPLIED TO SALT_MASS
===================================

Target changed:
  FROM: "m (соли), г" (original grams)
  TO:   "log_salt_mass" (log-transformed)

Transformation:
  Training:  log_salt_mass = log1p(m (соли), г) = log(1 + x)
  Inference: m (соли), г = expm1(log_salt_mass) = exp(x) - 1

Impact on distribution:
  Skewness: 2.957 → 1.135 (62% reduction)
  Std:      3.236г → 0.615 (in log-space)
  Range:    [0.107, 20.003]г → [0.102, 3.045] (in log-space)

Why this works:
  - Extreme right-skew (Cu+BTC: 5-20г vs others: 0.3-1.5г) → normalized
  - Linear models work well in log-space
  - Huber loss effective on near-normal distributions
  - Feature relationships become linear

Expected improvement:
  R² = 0.452 → ≥0.70 (target)
  MAE ≈ 0.45-0.50г
  cv_mean ≈ -0.40 to -0.45

Automatic inverse-transform:
  - Training: Predictions stored as both log and original units
  - Inference: Auto-converts log predictions back to grams
  - User sees only "m (соли), г" in final output
